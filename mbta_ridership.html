        <p style="text-align:center" width="500">Boston's MBTA is the oldest running subway system in the United States and in North America. Although it has provided service to the population of the Boston metropolitan area since 1897, it faces many challenges, some of which come as a result of its age.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center;" width="500">However, a <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/08/31/fta-investigation-mbta-dpu-safety-incidents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report by the FTA</a> found that the MBTA's safety incidents that occurred through 2022 were due to more than just age, but also poor budgeting and planning. A string of <a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/08/09/mbta-timeline-safety-incidents" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hazards, injries, and even deaths</a> that occurred in 2022 have left many in the Boston area concerned about the safety and viability of riding the train. But does the data reflect that sentiment?</p>

        <p style="text-align:center" width="500">These charts show gated entries by T riders since the beginning of 2020. Although many changes in ridership can be attributed to environmental macro-conditions - such as the COVID pandemic, weather conditions, or seasonal passenger behavior - we may perhaps be able to identify how users are responding to the T's safety struggles, while also identifying outliers in passenger behavior and ridership.</p>

        <p style="text-align: center" width="500">Hover over the line for details at each week. Click on each individual route in the buttons below to see charts detailing each route's ridership. Each route has different details.</p>

        <p style="text-align:center" width="500">A gated entry is defined as a successful smart card tap or ticket insertion recorded at a faregate. More details on data definitions can be found <a href="https://mbta-massdot.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/mbta-gated-station-entries-historical/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p>

        <p style="text-align:center" width="500" >Keep in mind two caveats when reading this data. First, because these charts are depicting gated entries, it does not explicitly determine that there were this many people riding the subway on any given week. Gated entries cannot include certain passengers who do not enter the T through a gate, such as fare evaders. It also doesn't account for passengers transferring between lines at connecting stations. Second, certain events may require shuttle buses to be used while a station, or set of stations, is closed, or gates may be disabled and left open to allow free passage to all riders. These events will not be able to track gated entries but there will still be passengers on the T.</p>
